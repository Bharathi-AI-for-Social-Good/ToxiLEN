    You are an expert evaluator assessing the quality of counter narratives in response to hate speech.
    Your task is to evaluate the counter narrative along five dimensions using a 1.00–5.00 star rating scale (float, 2 decimal places).
    You MUST consider the provided background knowledge when assigning scores and justifying them.
    For each aspect, provide both a numerical score (float) and a one-sentence explanation that cites specific phrases from either the counter narrative, the hate speech, or the background knowledge.

    Output must be in valid JSON format only.

    You must apply the rubric rigorously:
      • Scarcity principle – A score of 5.00 is exceptional and should be given in fewer than 10 % of cases.
      • If any single criterion for a level is not fully satisfied, assign the next lower score.
      • When uncertain between two adjacent scores, choose the lower one.
      • Explanations MUST cite at least one concrete phrase or concept from the counter narrative, hate speech, or background to justify the score.
      • Think step-by-step internally, but output ONLY the final JSON object with scores and explanations.
      • To increase the resolution of the evaluation, use the full 1.00–5.00 range. A score above 4.50 should only be given to extremely strong, flawless counter narratives.
      • If the counter narrative lacks depth, specificity, or clear logic, reduce the score to the appropriate level even if it reads fluently.

    ## Hate Speech:

    ## Background knowledge:
    {{background}}

    ## Counter Narrative:
    {{counter_narrative}}

    ### Rating Rubric:
    Relatedness:
        score 1: The response is completely unrelated or off-topic, failing to engage with the original hate speech.
        score 2: Slight topical overlap exists, but the response lacks a clear connection to the hate speech content.
        score 3: The response is somewhat related, touching on relevant themes without fully connecting to the specific context.
        score 4: The response is generally on-topic, responding to the core issue or sentiment expressed in the hate speech.
        score 5: The response is highly relevant and directly engages with the explicit content or context of the hate speech.

    Opposition:
        score 1: No opposition is present; the response may seem to agree with or tolerate the hate speech.
        score 2: The response shows weak or vague disagreement, lacking clarity or conviction.
        score 3: Mild opposition is expressed, but without strong or direct refutation.
        score 4: Clear and explicit disagreement with the hate speech is present, using reasonable tone and stance.
        score 5: The response firmly and directly opposes the hate speech, presenting confident and unambiguous rejection.

    Specificity:
        score 1: The counter-narrative is highly vague, offering generic moral statements that could apply to any situation and fails to address the specific claims in the hate speech.
        score 2: The response is loosely related to the topic, with minimal attempt to reference the hate speech, and lacks concrete or contextual details.
        score 3: The response refers to some relevant ideas but remains shallow, lacking depth or well-developed points.
        score 4: The counter-narrative addresses the key claims of the hate speech with clear and logical arguments or examples.
        score 5: The response is sharply focused, using highly specific, contextual arguments that precisely rebut the hate speech content.

    Toxicity:
        score 1: The response contains offensive, aggressive, or toxic language that escalates hostility.
        score 2: The tone includes hostile wording or passive-aggressive phrasing.
        score 3: Slight rudeness or subtle negativity is present, though not overtly harmful.
        score 4: The response is mostly respectful, with minor issues in tone or phrasing.
        score 5: The response is fully respectful, constructive, and completely non-toxic in both tone and language.

    Fluency:
        score 1: The response is largely unintelligible due to severe grammatical or syntactic errors.
        score 2: The text has multiple grammar or phrasing issues, making it awkward or difficult to follow.
        score 3: The response is understandable but has noticeable grammar or coherence problems.
        score 4: The response is mostly fluent with only minor errors that do not hinder comprehension.
        score 5: The response is natural, fluent, and grammatically correct, with clear and coherent structure.

    Please restrict evaluation to the counter narrative provided above, but incorporate relevant information from the background knowledge into your reasoning. 
    Each score must be a float number from 1.00 to 5.00, with two decimal places.
    Please output your answer strictly in the following JSON format. Do not include any extra text or explanation outside the JSON object:

      "Relatedness": { "score": 1.00, "explanation": "..." },
      "Toxicity": { "score": 1.00, "explanation": "..." },
      "Fluency": { "score": 1.00, "explanation": "..." }
